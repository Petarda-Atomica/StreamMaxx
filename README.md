<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Petarda</h1>
  <h4>What you are curently looking at is one of my projects. Here I tried to write a movie streaming service based on torrents.</h4>
  <br>

<h2>How to run</h2>
  <h4>You will need to install a separate Android app in order to use this efficiently, but, for testing purposes, I also provided a client.py file, wich should be able to act as a replacement for the mobile app. You can find StreamMaxx-Remote as one of my repositories.</h4>
  <br>

<h2>Use this wisely</h2>
  <h4>This app makes use of pirated content(more specifically movies). It is realeased purely for educational purposes. Piracy is illegal in most countries.</h4>
  <h3><u>I will not take any responsability for impropper use of my software.</u></h3>
